# Custom UITabbar and TabbarItem Layout in iOS Mobile App Base Project

### Project Overview
This project is a foundational framework for an iOS mobile app, aiming to achieve a highly customized UITabbar and TabbarItem layout. Through inheritance, the display and hiding of the Tabbar are encapsulated within a base class to enhance code maintainability and scalability.



### Architecture
- BaseClasses
- TabbarController
- LZ_TabbarController.swift
- LZ_CustomTabbar.swift
- BaseViewController
- LZ_BaseViewController.swift
- NavigationController
- LZ_NavigationController.swift
- Home
- HomeViewController.swift
- LZ_HomeViewController.swift
- LZ_SecondViewController.swift
- Resource
- images


### Class Descriptions
##### LZ_NavigationController
* Responsible for managing the logic of displaying and hiding the tabbar.

##### LZ_TabbarController
* Defines the custom Tabbar. load all the sub controllers.

##### LZ_CustomTabbar
* Defines the custom TabbarItem, reset items layout.

##### LZ_BaseViewController
* Base class for all ViewControllers with unified event handling.

### environment Instructions
* macOS    Sonoma 14.2.1
* Xcode      15.2 (15C500b)
* iOS          13(minium)
* swift	     5.X


### Considerations
The pod file can be ignored because there are no library dependencies



### Additional
In this project, I used my experience in iOS development by using a programming language that I am familiar with.Serving as the foundational structure for all new projects during my career in China.The structures are simple but follow MVC(Model-View-Controller)design architecture.

In summary, this project shows my skills and experience in iOS development.
