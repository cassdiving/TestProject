Custom UITabbar and TabbarItem Layout in iOS Mobile App Base Project


1.Project Overview
This project is a foundational framework for an iOS mobile app, aiming to achieve a highly customized UITabbar and TabbarItem layout. Through inheritance, the display and hiding of the Tabbar are encapsulated within a base class to enhance code maintainability and scalability.

3.Class Descriptions
3.1 LZ_NavigationController
Responsible for managing the logic of displaying and hiding the tabbar


3.2 LZ_TabbarController
Defines the custom Tabbar. load all the sub controllers


3.3 LZ_CustomTabbar
Defines the custom TabbarItem, reset items layout


3.4 LZ_BaseViewController
Base class for all ViewControllers with unified event handling


4. Usage Instructions
environment
macOS    Sonoma 14.2.1
Xcode      15.2 (15C500b)
iOS          13(minium)
swift             5.X




5. Considerations
The pod file can be ignored because there are no library dependencies






6. Additional
In this project, I used my experience in iOS development by using a programming language that I am familiar with.Serving as the foundational structure for all new projects during my career in China.The structures are simple but follow MVC(Model-View-Controller)design architecture.


In summary, this project shows my skills and experience in iOS development.
